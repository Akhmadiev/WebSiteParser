# WebSiteParser
Parsing the URL for selected strategies

# Getting started
If you need to create a new strategy, you have to add a new class and implement <b>IStrategy</b> interface

Now we have 3 strategies:
  - CssClassStrategy: Get all css classes from the URL
  - LinkStrategy: Get all links from the URL
  - ImgStrategy: Get all images from the URL
